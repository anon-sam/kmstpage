The project was developed by NASA  and contracted out to Lockheed Martin  with an expected cost for the entire mission of US$297 million. Its mission is to use spectrometers and a thermal imager to detect evidence of past or present water and ice  as well as study the planet's geology and radiation environment. It is hoped that the data Odyssey obtains will help answer the question of whether life existed on Mars and create a risk-assessment of the radiation that future astronauts on Mars might experience. It also acts as a relay for communications between the Mars Exploration Rovers  Mars Science Laboratory  and previously the Phoenix lander to Earth. The mission was named as a tribute to Arthur C. Clarke  evoking the name of 2001: A Space Odyssey.";

The ARES team sought to be selected and funded as a NASA Mars Scout Mission for a 2011 or 2013 launch window. However  the MAVEN mission was chosen instead. ARES was chosen as one of four finalists in that program.";

Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin  both American  landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20  1969  at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft  and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21.5 hours on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit.";

Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope  enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays  they are not detectable from Earth-based telescopes; therefore space-based telescopes are required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit  and its mission is ongoing as of  2018.";

It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008  and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft using a PSLV-XL rocket  serial number C11  on 22 October 2008 at 00:52 UTC from Satish Dhawan Space Centre  about 80 km (50 mi) north of Chennai. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced the project on course in his Independence Day speech on 15 August 2003. The mission was a major boost to India's space program  as India researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon. The vehicle was inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.";

It featured four main telescopes in one spacecraft  covering X-rays and gamma rays  including various specialized sub-instruments and detectors. Following 14 years of effort  the observatory was launched from Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS-37 on April 5  1991  and operated until its deorbit on June 4  2000. It was deployed in low earth orbit at 450 km (280 mi) to avoid the Van Allen radiation belt. It was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at that time at 17 000 kilograms (37 000 lb).";

It was designed to study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel)  by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4  2005  the Impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from the interior of the nucleus  forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud  obscuring the view of the impact crater.";

It included two highly advanced miniature space probes that were sent to Mars aboard the Mars Polar Lander in January 1999. The probes were named \"Scott\" and \"Amundsen\"  in honor of Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen  the first explorers to reach the Earth's South Pole. Intended to be the first spacecraft to penetrate below the surface of another planet  after entering the Mars atmosphere DS2 was to detach from the Mars Polar Lander mother ship and plummet to the surface using only an aeroshell impactor  with no parachute. The mission was declared a failure on March 13  2000  after all attempts to reestablish communications following the descent went unanswered.""";

EPOXI uses the Deep Impact spacecraft in a campaign consisting two missions: the Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) and Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh). DIXI aimed to send the Deep Impact spacecraft on a flyby of another comet  after its primary mission was completed in July 2005  while EPOCh saw the spacecraft's photographic instruments as a space observatory  studying extrasolar planets.";

It was intended to enable the development of future Earth imaging observatories that will have a significant increase in performance while also having reduced cost and mass. The spacecraft was part of the New Millennium Program. It was the first satellite to map active lava flows from space; the first to measure a facility's methane leak from space; and the first to track re-growth in a partially logged Amazon forest from space. EO-1 captured scenes such as the ash after the World Trade Center attacks  the flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina  volcanic eruptions and a large methane leak in southern California.";

FUSE was launched on a Delta II rocket on 24 June 1999  as a part of NASA's Origins program.  FUSE detected light in the far ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum  between 90.5-119.5 nanometres  which is mostly unobservable by other telescopes.  Its primary mission was to characterize universal deuterium in an effort to learn about the stellar processing times of deuterium left over from the Big Bang.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
FUSE resides in a low Earth orbit  approximately 760 km (410 nmi) in altitude  with an inclination of 25 degrees and just less than a 100-minute orbital period.  Its Explorer designation is Explorer 77.""";

Named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei  it consisted of an orbiter and an entry probe. It was delivered into Earth orbit on October 18  1989 by Space Shuttle Atlantis. Galileo arrived at Jupiter on December 7  1995  after gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth  and became the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. It launched the first probe into Jupiter  directly measuring its atmosphere. Despite suffering major antenna problems  Galileo achieved the first asteroid flyby  of 951 Gaspra  and discovered the first asteroid moon  Dactyl  around 243 Ida. In 1994  Galileo observed Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9's collision with Jupiter.";

The crash contaminated many of the sample collectors  and  although most were damaged  some of the collectors were successfully recovered.";

It was believed lost but as of August 2018 might be recoverable. It was launched 25 March 2000 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB on a two-year mission. Almost six years later  it unexpectedly ceased operations in December 2005 during its extended mission and was declared lost. The spacecraft was part of NASA's Sun-Earth Connections Program  and during its run had over 400 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals using its data. It had special cameras that provided various breakthroughs in understanding the dynamics of plasma around the Earth. The Principal Investigator was Jim Burch of the Southwest Research Institute.";

The mission was conceived as a low-cost means of determining the nature of hydrogen detected at the polar regions of the moon.  Launched immediately after discovery of lunar water by Chandrayaan-1  the main LCROSS mission objective was to further explore the presence of water ice in a permanently shadowed crater near a lunar polar region. It was successful in confirming water in the southern lunar crater Cabeus.";

The spacecraft originally carried a designation of ERTS-B (Earth Resource Technology Satellite B) but was renamed \"Landsat 2\" prior to its launch on January 22  1975. The objective of the satellite was to acquire global  seasonal data in medium resolution from a near-polar  sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite  built by General Electric  acquired data with the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). Despite having a design life of one year  Landsat 2 operated for over seven years  finally ceasing operations on February 25  1982.""";

Landsat 3  decommissioned on September 7  1983  beyond its design life of one year. The data collected during Landsat 3's lifetime was used by 31 countries. Countries that cannot afford their own satellite are able to use the data for ecological preservation efforts and to determine the location of natural resources.";

It was launched on July 16  1982  with the primary goal of providing a global archive of satellite imagery. Although the Landsat Program is managed by NASA  data from Landsat 4 was collected and distributed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Landsat 4 science operations ended on December 14  1993 when the satellite lost its ability to transmit science data  far beyond its designed life expectancy of five years. The satellite housekeeping telemetry and tracking continued to be maintained by NASA until it was decommissioned on June 15  2001.";

It was launched on a Minotaur V rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on September 7  2013. During its seven-month mission  LADEE orbited around the Moon's equator  using its instruments to study the lunar exosphere and dust in the Moon's vicinity. Instruments included a dust detector  neutral mass spectrometer  and ultraviolet-visible spectrometer  as well as a technology demonstration consisting of a laser communications terminal. The mission ended on April 18  2014  when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon  which  later  was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.";

It was given a more general objective  to \"perform a broad systematic photographic survey of lunar surface features in order to increase the scientific knowledge of their nature  origin  and processes  and to serve as a basis for selecting sites for more detailed scientific study by subsequent orbital and landing missions\". It was also equipped to collect selenodetic  radiation intensity  and micrometeoroid impact data. The spacecraft was placed in a cislunar trajectory and injected into an elliptical near polar high lunar orbit for data acquisition. The orbit was 2 706 by 6 111 kilometres (1 681 mi × 3 797 mi) with an inclination of 85.5 degrees and a period of 12 hours.""";

It was also equipped to collect selenodetic  radiation intensity  and micrometeoroid impact data and was used to evaluate the Manned Space Flight Network tracking stations and Apollo Orbit Determination Program. The spacecraft was placed in a cislunar trajectory and on August 5  1967 was injected into an elliptical near polar lunar orbit 194.5 by 6 023 kilometres (120.9 mi × 3 742.5 mi) with an inclination of 85 degrees and a period of 8 hours 30 minutes. On August 7 the perilune was lowered to 100 kilometers (62 mi)  and on August 9 the orbit was lowered to a 99-by-1 499-kilometer (62 mi × 931 mi)  3 hour 11 minute period.";

It cost $18.5 million in 1962. It was launched aboard an Atlas-Agena rocket on July 22  1962. Shortly after  takeoff the rocket responded improperly to commands from the guidance systems on the ground  setting the stage for an apparent software-related guidance system failure. With the craft effectively uncontrolled  a range safety officer ordered its destructive abort 294.5 seconds after launch.";

The first successful spacecraft in the NASA Mariner program  it was a simplified version of the Block I spacecraft of the Ranger program and an exact copy of Mariner 1. The missions of Mariner 1 and 2 spacecraft are together sometimes known as the Mariner R missions. Original plans called for the probes to be launched on the Atlas-Centaur  but serious developmental problems with that vehicle forced a switch to the much smaller Agena B stage. As such  the design of the Mariner R vehicles was greatly simplified. Far less instrumentation was carried than on the Soviet Venera probes of this period  including no TV camera as the Atlas-Agena B had only half as much lift capacity as the Soviet 8K78 booster. The Mariner 2 spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral on August 27  1962 and passed as close as 34 773 kilometers (21 607 mi) to Venus on December 14  1962.";

It was designed to conduct closeup scientific observations of Mars and to transmit these observations to Earth. Launched on November 28  1964  Mariner 4 performed the first successful flyby of the planet Mars  returning the first close-up pictures of the Martian surface. It captured the first images of another planet ever returned from deep space; their depiction of a cratered  seemingly dead world  largely changed the scientific community's view of life on Mars.  Other mission objectives were to perform field and particle measurements in interplanetary space in the vicinity of Mars and to provide experience in and knowledge of the engineering capabilities for interplanetary flights of long duration. On December 21  1967 communications with Mariner 4 were terminated.";

Mariner 6 was launched from Launch Complex 36B at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Mariner 7 from Launch Complex 36A at Cape Kennedy. The craft flew over the equator and south polar regions  analyzing the atmosphere and the surface with remote sensors  and recording and relaying hundreds of pictures. The mission's goals were to study the surface and atmosphere of Mars during close flybys  in order to establish the basis for future investigations  particularly those relevant to the search for extraterrestrial life  and to demonstrate and develop technologies required for future Mars missions. Mariner 6 also had the objective of providing experience and data which would be useful in programming the Mariner 7 encounter five days later.";

Mariner 9 was launched toward Mars on May 30  1971 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and reached the planet on November 14 of the same year  becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet – only narrowly beating the Soviets' Mars 2 and Mars 3  which both arrived within a month. After months of dust storms it managed to send back clear pictures of the surface.";

The project was developed by NASA  and contracted out to Lockheed Martin  with an expected cost for the entire mission of US$297 million. Its mission is to use spectrometers and a thermal imager to detect evidence of past or present water and ice  as well as study the planet's geology and radiation environment. It is hoped that the data Odyssey obtains will help answer the question of whether life existed on Mars and create a risk-assessment of the radiation that future astronauts on Mars might experience. It also acts as a relay for communications between the Mars Exploration Rovers  Mars Science Laboratory  and previously the Phoenix lander to Earth. The mission was named as a tribute to Arthur C. Clarke  evoking the name of 2001: A Space Odyssey.";

It formed part of the Mars Surveyor '98 mission. On December 3  1999  however  after the descent phase was expected to be complete  the lander failed to reestablish communication with Earth.  A post-mortem analysis determined the most likely cause of the mishap was premature termination of the engine firing prior to the lander touching the surface  causing it to strike the planet at a high velocity.";

The mission is managed by the California Institute of Technology  at the JPL  in Pasadena  California  for the NASA Science Mission Directorate  Washington  D.C. It was launched August 12  2005  and attained Martian orbit on March 10  2006. In November 2006  after five months of aerobraking  it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase. As MRO entered orbit  it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet's surface: Mars Global Surveyor  Mars Express  2001 Mars Odyssey  and the two Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity); at the time  this set a record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars. Mars Global Surveyor and the Spirit rover have since ceased to function; the remainder remain operational as of April 2018.";

Launched on 8 September 2016  its mission is to study asteroid 101955 Bennu  a carbonaceous asteroid  and return a sample to Earth on 24 September 2023 for detailed analysis. The material returned is expected to enable scientists to learn more about the formation and evolution of the Solar System  its initial stages of planet formation  and the source of organic compounds that led to the formation of life on Earth. If successful  OSIRIS-REx will be the first U.S. spacecraft to return samples from an asteroid.";

Launched on July 7  2003 as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program  it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25  2004  three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A) touched down on the other side of the planet. With a planned 90 sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 earth days)  Spirit functioned until getting stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010  while Opportunity was active as of June 10  2018 when a dust storm forced it to hibernation. It has operated 5601 sols since landing  having exceeded its operating plan by 14 years  194 days (in Earth time). Opportunity has operated for over 55 times its designed lifespan. As of June 10  2018 when contact was lost  the rover had traveled 45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles).";

With a planned 90 sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 earth days)  Spirit functioned until getting stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010  while Opportunity was active as of June 10  2018 when a dust storm forced it to hibernation. It has operated 5601 sols since landing  having exceeded its operating plan by 14 years  194 days (in Earth time). Opportunity has operated for over 55 times its designed lifespan. As of June 10  2018 when contact was lost  the rover had traveled 45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles).";

The original spacecraft was lost in a launch failure on 24 February 2009  when the payload fairing of the Taurus rocket which was carrying it failed to separate during ascent. The added mass of the fairing prevented the satellite from reaching orbit. It subsequently re-entered the atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean near Antarctica. The replacement satellite  Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2  was launched 2 July 2014 aboard a Delta II rocket. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3  a stand-alone payload built from the spare OCO-2 flight instrument  was to be installed on the International Space Station's Kibō Exposed Facility in December 2016 but is now scheduled as \"To Be Determined\".""";

It was designed by the United States Air Force (USAF) as the first satellite in the Pioneer program and was one of the first attempted launches beyond Earth orbit by any country  but the rocket failed shortly after launch. The probe was intended to be called Pioneer (or Pioneer 1)  but the launch failure precluded that name.";

It was the first probe to encounter Saturn and the second to fly through the asteroid belt and by Jupiter. Thereafter  Pioneer 11 became the second of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the Solar System. Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe  the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on September 30  1995  and the last good engineering data was received on November 24  1995.";

Launch took place at 07:30:00 UTC on November 8  1958. After Pioneer 1 had failed due to guidance system deficiencies  the guidance system was modified with a Doppler command system to ensure more accurate commands and minimize trajectory errors. Once again  the first and second stage portion of the flight was uneventful  but the third stage of the launch vehicle failed to ignite  making it impossible for Pioneer 2 to achieve orbital velocity. An attempt to fire the vernier engines on the probe was unsuccessful and the spacecraft attained a maximum altitude of 1 550 km (960 mi) before reentering Earth's atmosphere at 28.7 N  1.9 E over NW Africa. A small amount of data was obtained during the short flight  including evidence that the equatorial region around Earth has higher flux and higher energy radiation than previously considered and that the micrometeorite density is higher around Earth than in space. The reason for the third stage failure was unclear  but it was suspected that the firing command from the second stage  which contained the guidance package for the entire launch vehicle  was never received  possibly due to damage to electrical lines during staging.";

This spacecraft was intended as a lunar probe  but failed to go past the Moon and into a heliocentric orbit as planned  but did reach an altitude of 102 360 km before falling back to Earth. The revised spacecraft objectives were to measure radiation in the outer Van Allen radiation belt using two Geiger-Müller tubes and to test the trigger mechanism for a lunar photographic experiment.";

It carried a payload similar to Pioneer 3: a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger–Müller tube detector and a lunar photography experiment. It passed within 58 983 km of the Moon's surface. However  Pioneer 4 did not come close enough to trigger its photoelectric sensor. The spacecraft was still in solar orbit as of 1969. It was the only successful lunar probe launched by the U.S. in 12 attempts between 1958–63; only in 1964 would Ranger 7 surpass its success by accomplishing all of its mission objectives.";

The spacecraft was a 1-meter diameter sphere  with a propulsion module. It was launched on September 24  1959 on an Atlas C-Able launcher. It was to carry a TV camera and a magnetic field sensor. It was to be spin-stabilized  and was known as a 'paddlewheel' spacecraft. The Atlas-Able launch vehicle was destroyed in an explosion on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral during a pre-launch static test. The payload of P-1 spacecraft and Able IV space engine was not present on the launch vehicle when it exploded  and the payload was later used in the P-3 mission.";

The objectives were to place a highly instrumented probe in lunar orbit  to investigate the environment between the Earth and Moon  and to develop technology for controlling and maneuvering spacecraft from Earth. It was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system  estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles  record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites  and study radiation  magnetic fields  and low frequency electromagnetic waves in space. A mid-course propulsion system and injection rocket would have been the first United States self-contained propulsion system capable of operation many months after launch at great distances from Earth and the first U.S. tests of maneuvering a satellite in space.";

Its primary mission was to test the performance of those functions and parts necessary for carrying out subsequent lunar and planetary missions; a secondary objective was to study the nature of particles and fields in the space environment. Due to a launch vehicle malfunction  the spacecraft could only reach Low Earth orbit  rather than the high Earth orbit that had been planned  and was only able to complete part of its mission.";

An onboard computer failure caused failure of the deployment of the solar panels and navigation systems; as a result the spacecraft crashed on the far side of the Moon without returning any scientific data.

It was designed to achieve a lunar-impact trajectory and to transmit high-resolution photographs of the lunar surface during the final minutes of flight up to impact. The spacecraft carried six television vidicon cameras - two wide-angle (channel F  cameras A and B) and four narrow-angle (channel P) - to accomplish these objectives. The cameras were arranged in two separate chains  or channels  each self-contained with separate power supplies  timers  and transmitters so as to afford the greatest reliability and probability of obtaining high-quality television pictures. No other experiments were carried on the spacecraft. Due to a failure of the camera system  no images were returned.";

These pictures helped select landing sites for Apollo missions and were used for scientific study.  During its 1965 mission  Ranger 8 transmitted 7 137 lunar surface photographs before it crashed into the Moon as planned. This was the second successful mission in the Ranger series  following Ranger 7. Ranger 8's design and purpose were very similar to those of Ranger 7.  It had six television vidicon cameras: two full-scan and four partial-scan.  Its sole purpose was to document the Moon's surface.";

Planned as the first Teacher in Space Project in addition to observing Halley's Comet for six days  a structural failure during its ascent phase 73 seconds after launch on January 28  1986  from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 killed all seven crew members—Commander Dick Scobee  Pilot Michael J. Smith  Mission Specialists Ellison S. Onizuka  Judith A. Resnik and Ronald E. McNair  and Payload Specialists Gregory Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe—and destroyed the orbiter. Immediately after the disaster  NASA convened the Rogers Commission to determine the cause of the explosion. The failure of an O-ring seal on the starboard Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) was determined to have caused the shuttle to break-up in flight. Space Shuttle flights were suspended for 32 months while the hazards with the shuttle were addressed.";

It has front and rear cameras and hardware to conduct several scientific experiments. Designed for a mission lasting 7 sols  with possible extension to 30 sols  it was in fact active for 83 sols. The base station had its last communication session with Earth at 3:23 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on September 27  1997. The rover needed the base station to communicate with Earth  despite still functioning at the time communications ended.";

It has front and rear cameras and hardware to conduct several scientific experiments. Designed for a mission lasting 7 sols  with possible extension to 30 sols  it was in fact active for 83 sols. The base station had its last communication session with Earth at 3:23 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on September 27  1997. The rover needed the base station to communicate with Earth  despite still functioning at the time communications ended.";

One of the main goals of the mission was the hunt for Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of nearby stars other than the Sun. SIM was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010. In addition to detecting extrasolar planets  SIM would have helped astronomers construct a map of the Milky Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars  assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and in the local group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars. The spacecraft would have used optical interferometry to accomplish these and other scientific goals.";

Its primary mission was to collect dust samples from the coma of comet Wild 2  as well as samples of cosmic dust  and return these to Earth for analysis. It was the first sample return mission of its kind. En route to comet Wild 2  the craft also flew by and studied the asteroid 5535 Annefrank. The primary mission was successfully completed on 15 January 2006  when the sample return capsule returned to Earth.";

The mission was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on December 7  2001 aboard a Delta II rocket launch vehicle. The project is sponsored and managed by NASA  while the spacecraft was designed and assembled by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. The mission has been extended several times  and has now collected data over an entire solar cycle  which helps in its goal to differentiate  the Sun's effects on the atmosphere from other effects.";

During its 2-year primary mission  it is expected to find more than 20 000 exoplanets  compared to about 3 800 exoplanets known when it launched. The first light image from TESS was taken on August 7  2018  and released publicly on September 17  2018.";

It was also known as the X-ray Explorer Satellite  SAS-A (for \"Small Astronomy Satellite\" A  being first of the three-spacecraft SAS series)  SAS 1  or Explorer 42. The observatory was launched on December 12  1970 into an initial orbit of about 560 km apogee  520 km perigee  3 degrees inclination  with a period of 96 minutes. The mission ended in March 1973. Uhuru was a scanning mission  with a spin period of ~12 minutes. It performed the first comprehensive survey of the entire sky for X-ray sources  with a sensitivity of about 0.001 times the intensity of the Crab nebula.""";

Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett of Johns Hopkins University  the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University. The WMAP spacecraft was launched on June 30  2001 from Florida. The WMAP mission succeeded the COBE space mission and was the second medium-class (MIDEX) spacecraft in the NASA Explorers program. In 2003  MAP was renamed WMAP in honor of cosmologist David Todd Wilkinson (1935–2002)  who had been a member of the mission's science team. After nine years of operations  WMAP was switched off in 2010  following the launch of the more advanced Planck spacecraft by ESA in 2009.";
